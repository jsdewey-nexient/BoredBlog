# BoredBlog
This project is being developed in order for the developer to learn about the
Spring framework as well as other various Java utilities. It is also a project
for the developer to hone his personal coding skills and improve his coding
habits.

The project itself is being modeled as blog software. The blog is exposed as a
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) service with endpoints to perform basic 
CRUD (Create Retrieve Update Delete) operations on the following:

 * Posts, which hosts the content of the blog.
 * Comments, which are related to a particular Post.
 * Authors, who write Posts and Comments.
 * Guests, who write Comments.
 
With free time, this project will evolve to have more features.
